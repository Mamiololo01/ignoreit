* Install and navigate to vscode `settings.json` and ensure you have `"ignoreit.array": [".env", "node_modules", "coverage"]` as one of the key-value pairs. The array is a list of files and folders you wish to always ignore. Feel free to modify it.
* If any of the files or folders specified in the array exists in your project directory, `ignoreit` extension will add it to the `.gitignore` file.
* If `.gitignore` file does not exist in your project directory, `ignoreit` extension will create a `.gitignore` file and fill in the files you're to ignore.
* The `.gitignore` content will be the files in your project directory that corresponds to the `ignoreit.array`
* You can manually add other files to the `.gitignore` file. New files are always appended to the existing ones.
* If `.env` file is part of the files in your directory, `ignoreit` extension will create a `.env.example` file and fill it with the the contents of your .env file. Only variables are filled in, values are left behind. The `.env` and `.env.example` files will always be in sync.
